<p style="font-style:italic;">In general use, herbs are plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, medicinal purposes, or for fragrances; excluding vegetables and other plants consumed for macronutrients. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. Herbs generally refers to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while spices are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including seeds, bark, roots and fruits.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term "herb" differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as "herbs", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), resin and pericarp.</p>

<b><h3><u>YARSHAGUMBA</u></h3></b><p>
	<br><u>Yarsagumba - the gold rush</u><br><br>
	Yarsagumba with its Latin name cordyceps sinesis literally means summer plant and winter insect in Tibetan. Before the rainy season begins, spores of the cordyceps mushroom settle on the heads of caterpillars’ that lives underground. The fungus gets so much into the body of the caterpillars’ that it grows out through its head and drains all the energy from the insect and ultimately it dies. Yarsagumba, Yarshagumba or Yarchagumba is a rare and unique herb that grows in the meadows above 3,500 meters (11,483 feet) in the Himalayan region of Nepal. There are various types of famous medicinal plants found in Nepal but the popularity of yarsagumba is simply overwhelming. For the last couple of years, the trade of yarsagumba is increasing and it has been regarded as an expensive life saving tonic. Headache, toothache or any other disease - yarsagumba is the remedy. And not only that, it is also believed to be a cure for sexual impotency – a Himalayan Herbal Viagra.</p></td>

<p align=left>Every year during May and June, thousands of villagers from remote areas risking their own lives head for high mountains to collect yarsagumba. It is estimated that one villager can earn up to Rs. 2,500 approximately to $35 a day by collecting yarsagumba which is beyond the monthly salary of many Nepalese households. Dolpa – a remote district in western Nepal with high steep valleys and dry climate is one of the foremost areas for collecting yarsagumba. Almost 50% of the annual supply of yarsagumba comes from Dolpa alone. Here, not only the adults but school goers also take unofficial holidays in search of the gold rush.</p>


<p align=left>Collection of yarsagumba was illegal until 2001 but following its popularity and the lobbying from various organizations, the Government lifted the ban but imposed a royalty rate of Rs. 20,000 (US$ 280) per kilogram (2.2lbs). One kilo of yarsagumba that costs about Rs. 315 (US$ 5/6) in 1992 increased to Rs. 105,000 (US$ 1,435) by the year 2002 and the price has been shooting up so as the international interest on the mysterious half-caterpillar-half-mushroom known as yarshagumba.</p><br>

<b><h3><u>SHATAVARI</u></h3></b><p><br>
Famous worldwide, with the name of Asparagus, Asparagus (it is called ‘Asparagus’ in Nepali and for my convenience I will use that name, my apology to the foreign readers, throughout this post) is not a new plant in Nepal. It is a subtropical plant that can be found easily in the forests of the Hilly and Terai regions of Nepal. Our fathers and grandfathers generations were well aware about the benefits and utility of Asparagus. They used to collect the shoots of Asparaguss for consuming them as vegetable from the forests. (I am jealous that they didn’t even have to cultivate and grow it in their farms!) Similarly, they used its root as a medicine notably for animals like cows and buffaloes. Therefore, it is a popular plant for it great nutritional and medicinal value.</p></td>

<p align=left>Young Asparagus shoots can be used to prepare vegetable. The vegetable of Asparagus is very tasty, according to the claim of those who have eaten. However, it is not only tasty but quite nutritional as well. That is the justification of its high selling price in the market. The foreign researches also indicate its supreme nutritional value. Therefore, since it is good for our health it is important for us to consume it, at least occasionally.</li>


<p align=left><u>Uses : <br></u></p>
<ul>
<li>The root of Satavari (Kurilo)is used in the form of juice, paste, decoction and powder to treat intrinsic haemorrhage, diarrhoea, piles, hoarseness of voice, cough, arthritis, poisoning, diseases of female genital tract, erysipelas, fever, as aphrodisiac and as rejuvinative.</li><br>

<li>Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) is a subtropical plant found in Asia that has, for thousands of years, been revered as one of the most diverse medicinal plants for women. Shatavari is Sanskrit for, “she who posses one hundred husbands” and in ayurvedic medicine of ancient India it is considered the most important rejuvenative plant for women.</li><br>

<li>It is said that this wild asparagus is especially effective in preserving the beauty and vitality (ojas) of whoever consumes it, and thus has healing qualities for both men and women. However, Shatavari is mainly used due to its rejuvenative effect on the female genitalia. The plant contains saponins, which harmonize and stimulate the body’s hormone balance, which can be a vital support during menopause.</li><br>

<li>Consumption of Shatavari stimulates milk production and nurtures the ovaries. This wonderful root is prescribed to promote milk secretion during and after pregnancy, while fostering healthy development of the breasts, and having a beneficial and strong effect on the embryo. It also helps to prepare the female genitalia for birth.</li><br>

<li>Shatavari’s adaptogenic effect also bestows the strength to deal with times of extreme stress in one’s life.</li><br>

<li>By balancing pitta and vata, shatavari nurtures interpersonal love and awakens commitment, so having a calming effect on both body and mind. This also enables one to overcome fiery emotions such as anger, jealousy and hate, and thus Shatavari is recommended for those in romantic relationships and those suffering from uneasiness.</li><br>

<li>Shatavari is known as a potent aphrodisiac for both genders, and is said to increase fertility. Additionally, this plant is known to support digestion and is often used to treat internal and external ulcers because of its anti-bacterial properties.</li></ul><br>

<b><h3><u>MARIJUANA</u></h3></b><p><br>

<u>What is Marijuana?</u><br><br>
Marijuana—also called weed, herb, pot, grass, bud, ganja, Mary Jane, and a vast number of other slang terms—is a greenish-gray mixture of the dried flowers of Cannabis sativa. Some people smoke marijuana in hand-rolled cigarettes called joints; in pipes, water pipes (sometimes called bongs), or in blunts (marijuana rolled in cigar wraps). Marijuana can also be used to brew tea and, particularly when it is sold or consumed for medicinal purposes, is frequently mixed into foods (edibles) such as brownies, cookies, or candies. Vaporizers are also increasingly used to consume marijuana. Stronger forms of marijuana include sinsemilla (from specially tended female plants) and concentrated resins containing high doses of marijuana’s active ingredients, including honeylike hash oil, waxy budder, and hard amberlike shatter. These resins are increasingly popular among those who use them both recreationally and medically.</p></td>

<u>What is the scope of marijuana use in the Nepal?</u><br><br>
Cannabis in Nepal has been illegal since 1973, but the region has a long history of use of cannabis as an intoxicant, and continues to produce cannabis illicitly.</p>


<p align=left>
Nepal has used psychoactive cannabis for centuries, and as early as the 1700s Nepalese charas was recognized as the best available.</p>

<p align=left>In the 1960s, the Hippie Trail began to route young Western adventurers through Nepal. The stable traditional cannabis economy was rocked by the influx of demand, and the heavy usage by visitors normalized and made trendy cannabis consumption locally. The increased demand and linkage to outside markets led to an increase in hashish production, and smuggling routes established through India and out to the wider world.</p>


<p align=left>In 1973, Nepal canceled the licenses of all cannabis shops, dealers, and farmers, under pressure from the United States and the international community. However, personal cultivation and use were unaffected, and cannabis commerce continued illicitly. The loss of $100,000 in government revenues caused disruption, and later in the 1970s attempts were made at crop substitution.</p>

<p align=left>Marijuana is an illegal drug in many parts of the world including Nepal. However, there are no strict charges for smoking marijuana in some countries like, Spain, Czech Republic, Portugal, and it’s even legalized in some states of the USA including Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. And in 2018, Canada became the third country in the world to federally legalize cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes.</p>


<p align=left>In Nepal, cannabis seeds are also used in making pickles "bhang ko achar". The dried seeds are ground and then mixed with aalo (potato). This is common in hilly area like Kathmandu, Pokhara of Nepal.</p>

<b><h3><u>CALAMUS</u></h3></b><p><br>

<u>Description:</u><br><br>Acorus calamus is the botanical name of the plant more commonly known as calamus. Other common names of calamus include calamus root, flag root, muskrat root, sweet calomel, sweet flag, sweet sedge, and many other names.</p>
<td><br><br><br><p><a href=file:///home/mystery/Desktop/Natural%20herbs%20in%20Nepal/11.jpg><img src=11.jpg alt="Calamus" title="Calamus" width=40% height=30% /></a>
</p></td></td></tr></table>



<p align=left>The plant has a branched and aromatic root or rhizome (underground horizontal stem of a plant that produces roots) from which rise its long erect leaves. The roots have a sweet fragrance (they have been used to flavor candy) and the leaves smell similar to lemon.</p>
<p align=left>
<u>Uses and Importance:</u><br><br>
In Ayurvedic medicine calamus is an important herb, and is valued as a rejuvenator for the brain and nervous system, and as a remedy for digestive disorders.</p>

<p align=left>But today, the use of calamus in digestive medicines has been discontinued in some countries because of possible toxic and carcinogenic effects. Toxicity is ascribed to beta-asarone. This compound may cause duodenal and liver cancer.</p>

<p align=left>Acorus calamus extract is anti-rheumatic and analgesic. The extract is used in the form of powder and balms and it is very much useful in case of asthma, bronchitis and cough. As per Indian Ayurveda it was used as an anesthetic for toothache and headaches.</p>

<p align=left>The rhizome contains from 1.5-3.5% essential oil which is extracted from the fresh roots or the unpeeled dried root by steam distillation. The essential oil is anticonvulsant, antiveratrinic and antiarrhythmic. It is also taken as an infusion, tincture or fluid extract.</p>

<p align=left>Calamus oil should never be used in aromatherapy. Even though it is fairly safe as an herbal medicine when administered properly, users should not use it long-term or exceed recommended dosages.</p>
